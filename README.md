# Particle_feature

## Installation
### Initial configuration
* Clone this repository into your ROS2 (jazzy) workspace 
* Add the contents of your current /src folder into this workspace. The .gitignore guarantees that these additional folders and files won't be tracked, so they won't appear as unstaged or uncommited changes.
* Delete the old /src folder and change the name of the /particleFeature folder to /src.
